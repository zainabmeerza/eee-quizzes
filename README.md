        <li>To find a selection of trustworthy recommendations for restraunts, hotels and markets.</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>UX</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Strategy</strong></h2>
The strategy approach for this site was to provide reputable trustworthy  content that users would be able to rely on for guidance. Additionally ease of access and simplicity was important to allow users to find the specifc information that they require to help plan their trips. Promoting users to travel to Istanbul and making it on their top list of travel choices was also the aim. 

An essential part is to define who the target users of this website would be,and to consider what features they would like to see.

<strong>The ideal users of this website would be:</strong>
<ul>
<li>People (such as tourists) intertested in visiting Istanbul, Turkey. </li>
<li>Families and groups looking to book a holiday. </li>
<li>Backpacking travellers.</li>
<li>First time travellers to Turkey. </li>
</ul>

<strong>This project will help these users by:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Providing a clear and concise guide that would be easy for them to navigate and focuses on important details.</li>
<li>Showing a selection of beautiful photos that will motivate and encourage travellers to visit, and help promote the city and make it seem as the more desirable choice. </li>
<li>Providing a list of the best sightseeing destinations and a brief background of these places.</li>
<li>Giving the users recommencedation of where to eat and stay during their trip.</li>
<li>Allowing them to subscribe to a newsletter that will keep them updated with the latest events and email them a downloadable travel guide brochure</li>
</ul>

The information was kept as minimal as possible in order to not overwhelm users, but instead focus more on making it seem more visually appealing. Hence including several forms of media (pop-up modal images, videos, maps, carousels) that they could interact with rather than just lots of text.
<br>

<strong>User stories:</strong>
<ol>
<li>As a first time visitor to the site, I would like to be able to navigate eaily throughtout the site and find the relevant information I need. </li>
<li>As a first time tourist, I would like some reliable recommendations of where I should visit, which restraunts I should go eat in, and where I can accommodate during my stay that fits in with my budget.</li>
<li>As a returning visitor to the site, I would like to stay updated with the latest events, trips, tours and festivals that are possibly taking place during the time of my visit to Istanbul.</li>
<li>As a first time traveller to Istanbul, I would like to know some background information as to what I should expect from this city and what it is popular and known for. </li>
<li>As a business owner, I would potentially be interested in advertising and promoting my service (restraunt, hotel or product etc.) onto the site to potenial customers(tourists) who may visit. </li>
<li>As a freelancing photographer, I would potentially like to feature my photographs of Istanbul to promote my work and gain exposure. </li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Surface</strong></h2>

The Google fonts 'Oswald' and 'Roboto' were used consistently across the entire website. 'Oswald' was used for headings whilst 'Roboto' was used for the body text. 

The color pallete used was generated by an online tool. Encorprating white and red into the colour scheme was important as it matched with the flag of Turkey. Additionally I wanted to add some shade of blue/green as it resonates with the nature of the city; plenty of blue seas and forestry. I paired this with white and a yellow shade to contrast. The colour pallette generated and used is shown below.

To stand out when hovering over links (such as icons for social media and navigation links) the color changes from white to yellow. Additionally, a yellow underline is included in the navigation bar to further indicate to the user what page they are currently on. 
<br>

<h1><strong>Features</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Header</strong></h2>
The website consists of four completed pages; Home, Attractions and Gallery, Form. It also consists of two uncompleted pages; Lodging and Dining. The header of the wesbite includes a logo and menu bar on the top of every page with a consistnet style. This will allow the user to efficiently move around and access the relevant information they require via the menu. The navigation links remain active when in use and this is indicated by a yellow underline. Additionally this menu bar is responsive across various devices. When being viewed on smaller devices such as mobile phones, the menu is collapsed into a hamburger icon that can be expaned when clicked on. The title in the header is also linked to the home page.
<br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Footer</strong></h2>
Every page has a footer which includes a 'visit istanbul' slogan, quick links to the other pages of the site (to avoid scrolling to the top), alternatively there is also an arrow icon at the bottom of the page that is linked to scroll to the top of the page when clicked on. Social media icons are displayed which are linked to the blog's social media accounts.
<br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Home</strong></h2>
The Home page starts with a large hero image with a scenic view of the coast in Istanbul. Below this a section on 'Why you should visit' is included. Thiis section only icludes a single quote in order to be kept short and convinving to users at first glance. Underneath this is the main text content of the home page which introduces the user with the purpose of the site. This section is divided into three columns; the first two columns are filled with text, and the column on the right includes an image of a famous bridge. To let the user know more about Istanbul before going further into browsing the website, two youtube videos are linked below this section using an embedded link from Youtube. Including a video is another way of providing the user with information without overwhelming them with too many words but rather showing them instead. Finally, an interactive map section is also included and this is done by using an embedded link from Google Maps. This allows the users to explore places visually on a map rather than just by reading text. 
<br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Attractions</strong></h2>
This page consists of the majority of the information on the website. It provides an overview of the most famous spots to visit and the history behind each location. Alongside the text for each location an interative and responsive carousel of images is included to make it more visually appealing to users. The title of this page is an h2 element that sits underneath the responsive menu bar. The content on this page is built using h2 and p elements. The images are set to float to the left, and the paragraphs are set to float to the right.
<br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Gallery</strong></h2>
 This page follows the same header and title format as the previous pages to keep the consitency. The main body is made up of a gallery modal pop-up images consiting of 30 pictures retrieved from Unsplash with their respective captions on each photo. This gallery was created using FancyBox libaries that were linked to my HTML code. The gallery is aligned to center the page and is responsive across different devices.
 <br>
 <br>
<h2><strong>Subscribe</strong></h2>
At the bottom of every page, right above the footer a sign up section had been included. This section has the heading 'Sign up to recieve a travel guide brochure' with a 'subscribe' button underneath. This button links to the form page. The form page includes a simple signup form that allows the user to subscribe to a regular newsletter from the travel blog and recieve a downloadable travel guide brochure via email. The form is made up of 2 text inputs for the name, and one email input. They have all been set to required, therefore the form is not completed until all fields have been filled out. The background on this page provides a sceneic image of the city that does not interfere with the styling of the form. This form is also responsive across different devices.
<br>
<br>
<h1><strong>Features to Implement in the future:</strong></h1>
Due to limited time I was unable to include content in the lodging and dining pages as I planned to do so. Furthermore, due to my limited skills and scope of knowledge, there are several features and widgets I would hope to also implement in a future release of this project. These inlude:
<ul>
<li>Embedded weather widgets that would let the user know about the current weather conditions in Istanbul.</li>
<li>A lodging section filled with a list of hotels, hostels, resorts, B&B's that can be sorted according to their rating, availability, room type, number of guests, and price range. It will also include images and customer reviews. </li>
<li>A dining section filled with a list of restraunts, cafes, bakeries that can be sorted according to their rating and region. It will also include images and customer reviews. </li>
<li>An FAQ section with commonly asked questions to address some tips and advice to users planning on travelling to Istanbul.</li>
<li>A page advertising the latest and upcoming events in Istanbul such as concerts and festivals. This will include adverts from several business companies.</li>
<li>A page that includes a list of experiences, such as day trips, cruises, ferry rides, museum visits, etc. This will also inlcude ticket information, prices, booking information, and opening times. </li>
<li>A section with pre-planned itentaires that can be downloaded as a PDF file and printed out for users to follow.</li>
<li>The option to chose the language of the site. As this is a travel website, customers from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and countries are expected to be browsing, and hence being able to tailor the language to their needs can help improve their accessibility.</li>
<li>The option to change currency options when viewing ticket prices or hotel prices.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>HTML Validation</strong></h2>
I used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C Markup Validation</a> to check the validity of my HTML documents. Several issues were identified using this tool.
<h3>Four errors were identified, these were:</h3>
<img src="assets/images/html-errors.png">
<h3>Three warnings were identified, these were:</h3>
<img src="assets/images/html-warnings.png">
And so the HTML was adjusted accordingly to improve on the errors. 
<br>
<h2><strong>CSS Validation</strong></h2>
I used <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">W3C CSS Validation</a> to check the validity of my CSS code. Several issues were identified using this tool.
<h3>Six errors were identified, these were:</h3>
<img src="assets/images/css-errors.png">
And so the HTML was adjusted accordingly to improve on the errors. 
<br>
<h2><strong>Light House</strong></h2>
Lighthouse is a testing tool featured as part of Google Chrome developer tools. It is used to test the performance of the website. Initially my Gallery and Attractions page achieved a very low score in performance and this was because of the unecissarily high quality of images that I was using. Hence to improve the performance I replaced the images with smaller size and this improved my performance score immensely. I also added some meta tags to improve the SEO performance. The final results I achieved are all above 90 for all scores (apart from the best practices on the home page, this was due to the 3 iframe elements I used with embedded links).
<br>
<h3>Results of light house testing on the single page created:</h3>
<img src="assets/readmeimages/light-house.png">

<h2><strong>WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation</strong></h2>
I then used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WAVE</a> which is a web accessibility evaluation tool. The results obtained are shown below. This showed that the color contrast on the project was weak and requires improvement.
<img src="assets/images/WAVE-test.png">

<h1><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></h1>
I would like to extend my thanks to my course mentor Guido Cecilio for his feedback and guidance throughout the course of this project. His support and advice during our meetings helped me advance this project into the right direction.
