<h1><strong>EEE Quizzes</strong></h1>

<h2>Code Institute Milestone Project 2 -
Interactive Frontend Development</h2>

<p>
    The aim of the second project is to develop an interactive website using HTML, CSS and JS. The website is designed such that it follows industry standard UX conventions. This website is made for educational purposes only. 
</p>

<a href="https://zainabmeerza.github.io/eee-quizzes/" target="_blank" >View the live website in GitHub Pages</a>

<img src="assets/readmeimages/am-i-responsive.png" height="350px" width="600px" alt="screenshot of the responsiveness of the website" >

<p>This image is produced using the tool from <a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#" target="_blank">Am I Responsive</a></p>

<p>This website is created to provide students and teachers with educational resources that may help them for revision, class learning activities or even homework. It can be useful to any user who has an interest in learning about electronics and electrical circuits as a hobby. It provides them with a variety of quizzes, of different difficulties that cover a range of different topics. 
 </p>

The website is divided into the following sections listed below:
    <ol>
        <li>The Main Menu - made up of a slider to provide the user with an overview of all the quizzes to select from and start.</li>
        <li>The Quiz Questions  - an interactive quiz made up of 10 questions, where 4 multiple choice answers is included for each question.</li>
        <li>The Final Score - Displays the final score the user obtained from the quiz and redirects them back to the Main Menu to select another quiz.</li>
    </ol>

<h3><strong>The business goals of this website are the following:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        To provide an educational learning platform for students. </li>
        <li>To provide teachers and schools leaarning resources for classroom activities</li>
        <li>To create a user friendly and easy to navigate website.</li>
    </ul>

<h3><strong>The customer goals of this website are the following:</strong></h3>
 <ul>
        <li>To have a reliable and interactive platform which is enaging the user whilst studying. </li>
        <li>To let the user briefly determine their level of knowledge on electrical circuits.</li>
        <li>To learn new information by acknowledging which questions were answered correctly or incorrectly. </li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>UX</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Strategy</strong></h2>
The strategy approach for this site was to provide a variety of different quizzes that users would be able to intereact with to gain exposure to a wide range of topics within this subject area. Additionally ease of access and simplicity was important to allow users to navigate through clearly.
<br>
An essential part is to define who the target users of this website would be,and to consider what features they would like to see.

<strong>The ideal users of this website would be:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students studying physics, electrical or electronics engineering. </li>
<li>Students interested in electronics and electrical circuits. </li>
<li>Teachers looking for engaging class activities and homework.</li>
<li>Students that would like to test and improve their knowledge on how electrical circuits operate. </li>
</ul>

<strong>This project will help these users by:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Providing a clear menu of quizzes that would be easy for them to navigate through.</li>
<li>Showing a selection of different quizzes that vary in difficulty and  </li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<br>

<strong>User stories:</strong>
<ol>
<li>As a first time visitor to the site, I would like to be able to navigate eaily throughtout the site and find the relevant information I need. </li>
<li>As a first time tourist, I would like some reliable recommendations of where I should visit, which restraunts I should go eat in, and where I can accommodate during my stay that fits in with my budget.</li>
<li>As a returning visitor to the site, I would like to stay updated with the latest events, trips, tours and festivals that are possibly taking place during the time of my visit to Istanbul.</li>
<li>As a first time traveller to Istanbul, I would like to know some background information as to what I should expect from this city and what it is popular and known for. </li>
<li>As a business owner, I would potentially be interested in advertising and promoting my service (restraunt, hotel or product etc.) onto the site to potenial customers(tourists) who may visit. </li>
<li>As a freelancing photographer, I would potentially like to feature my photographs of Istanbul to promote my work and gain exposure. </li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Scope</strong></h2>
To achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features have been included in this project release:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li> A landing page:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A header containing the title of the page </li>
        <li>A Main Menu with an interactive slider to select a quiz.</li>
        <li>A diagram for each quiz that is related to the topic   of that specific quiz.</li>
        <li>Each quiz has a level of difficulty specified.</li>
        <li>A clear start button on each quiz.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
<li> A quiz page:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>A progress bar indicating the current question.</li>
    <li>A back to main menu button.</li>
    <li>10 questions and 4 multiple choice answers to choose from for each question </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
<li> A final score page: </li>
    <ul>
        <li>The user's final score</li>
        <li>Back to main menu button</li>
    </ul>
 </ol>

<h2><strong>Structure</strong></h2>
This website is made up of 3 sections; the main menu, the quiz, and the final score. All these 3 sections were created on one single HTML page; and hence the website is made up of 1 page in total. Using CSS and JS, I was able to only display one section at a time and keep the other two hidden. The website landing page displays the main menu whilst keeping the quiz questions and final score reveal hidden. In the event that a quiz start button is clicked, the main menu is set to hidden, the quiz questions is set to display whilst the final score reveal remains hidden. Once the last question on the quiz has been answered, the quiz questions is set to hidden and the final score reveal is set to display. <br><br>
Therefore the flow of this website goes from main menu, to quiz, to final score and back to main menu. The website has 6 quizzes in total to choose from, where each quiz is made up of 10 questions and four possible answer buttons. The website is responsive across several devices.
<br><br>

<h2><strong>Skeleton</strong></h2>

The website consits of one single page, it consists of 3 sections that are not displayed all at once, but are displayed one at a time. 

<h3>The wireframe mockups for the landing page:</h3>
<a href="" target="_blank" >Landing Page - Desktop View</a>

<br>
<a href="" target="_blank" >Final Score Page - Mobile View</a> 

<br>
<br>

<h2><strong>Surface</strong></h2>

The Google fonts 'Urbanist' and 'Roboto' were used consistently across the entire website. 'Roboto' was used for headings whilst 'Urbanist' was used for the body text. 

The color pallete used was generated by an online tool. The colour pallette generated and used is shown below.

To stand out when hovering over links (such as icons for social media and navigation links) the color changes from white to yellow. Additionally, a yellow underline is included in the navigation bar to further indicate to the user what page they are currently on. 
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/readmeimages/pallette.png" >


<h1><strong>Features</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Header</strong></h2>
The website consists of four completed pages; Home, Attractions and Gallery, Form. It also consists of two uncompleted pages; Lodging and Dining. The header of the wesbite includes a logo and menu bar on the top of every page with a consistnet style. This will allow the user to efficiently move around and access the relevant information they require via the menu. The navigation links remain active when in use and this is indicated by a yellow underline. Additionally this menu bar is responsive across various devices. When being viewed on smaller devices such as mobile phones, the menu is collapsed into a hamburger icon that can be expaned when clicked on. The title in the header is also linked to the home page.
<br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Footer</strong></h2>
Every page has a footer which includes a 'visit istanbul' slogan, quick links to the other pages of the site (to avoid scrolling to the top), alternatively there is also an arrow icon at the bottom of the page that is linked to scroll to the top of the page when clicked on. Social media icons are displayed which are linked to the blog's social media accounts.
<br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Home</strong></h2>
The Home page starts with a large hero image with a scenic view of the coast in Istanbul. Below this a section on 'Why you should visit' is included. Thiis section only icludes a single quote in order to be kept short and convinving to users at first glance. Underneath this is the main text content of the home page which introduces the user with the purpose of the site. This section is divided into three columns; the first two columns are filled with text, and the column on the right includes an image of a famous bridge. To let the user know more about Istanbul before going further into browsing the website, two youtube videos are linked below this section using an embedded link from Youtube. Including a video is another way of providing the user with information without overwhelming them with too many words but rather showing them instead. Finally, an interactive map section is also included and this is done by using an embedded link from Google Maps. This allows the users to explore places visually on a map rather than just by reading text. 
<br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Attractions</strong></h2>
This page consists of the majority of the information on the website. It provides an overview of the most famous spots to visit and the history behind each location. Alongside the text for each location an interative and responsive carousel of images is included to make it more visually appealing to users. The title of this page is an h2 element that sits underneath the responsive menu bar. The content on this page is built using h2 and p elements. The images are set to float to the left, and the paragraphs are set to float to the right.
<br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Gallery</strong></h2>
 This page follows the same header and title format as the previous pages to keep the consitency. The main body is made up of a gallery modal pop-up images consiting of 30 pictures retrieved from Unsplash with their respective captions on each photo. This gallery was created using FancyBox libaries that were linked to my HTML code. The gallery is aligned to center the page and is responsive across different devices.
 <br>
 <br>
<h2><strong>Subscribe</strong></h2>
At the bottom of every page, right above the footer a sign up section had been included. This section has the heading 'Sign up to recieve a travel guide brochure' with a 'subscribe' button underneath. This button links to the form page. The form page includes a simple signup form that allows the user to subscribe to a regular newsletter from the travel blog and recieve a downloadable travel guide brochure via email. The form is made up of 2 text inputs for the name, and one email input. They have all been set to required, therefore the form is not completed until all fields have been filled out. The background on this page provides a sceneic image of the city that does not interfere with the styling of the form. This form is also responsive across different devices.
<br>
<br>
<h1><strong>Features to Implement in the future:</strong></h1>
Due to limited time I was unable to include content in the lodging and dining pages as I planned to do so. Furthermore, due to my limited skills and scope of knowledge, there are several features and widgets I would hope to also implement in a future release of this project. These inlude:
<ul>
<li>Embedded weather widgets that would let the user know about the current weather conditions in Istanbul.</li>
<li>A lodging section filled with a list of hotels, hostels, resorts, B&B's that can be sorted according to their rating, availability, room type, number of guests, and price range. It will also include images and customer reviews. </li>
<li>A dining section filled with a list of restraunts, cafes, bakeries that can be sorted according to their rating and region. It will also include images and customer reviews. </li>
<li>An FAQ section with commonly asked questions to address some tips and advice to users planning on travelling to Istanbul.</li>
<li>A page advertising the latest and upcoming events in Istanbul such as concerts and festivals. This will include adverts from several business companies.</li>
<li>A page that includes a list of experiences, such as day trips, cruises, ferry rides, museum visits, etc. This will also inlcude ticket information, prices, booking information, and opening times. </li>
<li>A section with pre-planned itentaires that can be downloaded as a PDF file and printed out for users to follow.</li>
<li>The option to chose the language of the site. As this is a travel website, customers from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and countries are expected to be browsing, and hence being able to tailor the language to their needs can help improve their accessibility.</li>
<li>The option to change currency options when viewing ticket prices or hotel prices.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>HTML Validation</strong></h2>
I used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C Markup Validation</a> to check the validity of my HTML documents. Several issues were identified using this tool.
<br>
<br>
No errors were identified but four warnings were brought up and so the HTML was adjusted accordingly to eliminate these.
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/readmeimages/HTML-test.png">
<br>  
<br>
<h2><strong>CSS Validation</strong></h2>
I used <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">W3C CSS Validation</a> to check the validity of my CSS code. Several issues were identified using this tool.
<br>
<br>
Four errors were identified, and so the CSS was adjusted accordingly to improve on the errors. The <a href="https://github.com/zainabmeerza/eee-quizzes/blob/main/assets/css/style.css" target="_blank"> style.css</a> file was validated with no errors as this was the CSS file written by me. The other CSS file was borrowed as part of JQuery, hence has no errors but some warnings.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Light House</strong></h2>
Lighthouse is a testing tool featured as part of Google Chrome developer tools. It is used to test the performance of the website. Initially the page achieved a very low score in performance and this was because of the high quality images used in the main menu that was not needed. To improve the performance, they were replaced with images of smaller sizes and this improved the performance score immensely. I also added some meta tags to improve the SEO performance. The final results I achieved are all above 90 for all scores.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Results of Light House testing on the single page created:</h3>
<br>
<img src="assets/readmeimages/light-house.png">

<h2><strong>WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation</strong></h2>
I then used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WAVE</a> which is a web accessibility evaluation tool. The results obtained from this test are shown below. This showed that the color contrast on the project was weak and coulb be improvement in tthe future. 
<br>
<br>
